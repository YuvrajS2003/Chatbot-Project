# Chatbot
Welcome to the Chatbot Project! This repository contains a chatbot developed and trained using Jupyter Notebook. The project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a simple AI-powered conversational agent using Python and various machine learning libraries.


## Project Overview
This chatbot is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It can understand user queries and respond with relevant information or actions. The project is aimed at demonstrating how to:

- Preprocess text data for chatbot applications.
- Build a machine learning model using libraries like numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras and Pickle.
- Train the chatbot using conversational datasets.
- Deploy and interact with the chatbot.

## Features
- Natural Language Understanding: The bot can understand and process text input.
- Training and Retraining: The chatbot model can be retrained using Jupyter Notebook.
- Extensible Architecture: Easily extend the bot with more intents and responses.
- Simple and Modular Code: Easy-to-understand and modular code structure.
- Customizable: Allows for custom datasets and intents to be added.

## File Structure
- Chatbot.ipynb - Jupyter notebook used for implementation
- chatbot_model.h5 - A plot analysing regression between training and testing dataset
- README.md - this file
- test_qa.txt - Test dataset
- train_qa.txt - Trained dataset

## Model Training
- Update the test_qa.txt and train_qa.txt files with new intents and responses.
- Run the cells in the Chatbot.ipynb notebook to retrain the model.
- Save the trained model for future use.

## Conclusion
This Chatbot Project provides a solid foundation for building and training conversational agents using machine learning techniques in Jupyter Notebook. With its modular and extensible design, the project is suitable for both beginners and experienced developers looking to experiment with natural language processing (NLP). By following the steps outlined in this repository, you can customize the chatbot to fit your specific needs, extend its capabilities, and even deploy it to real-world applications.

We hope this project serves as a helpful starting point for your chatbot endeavors. Happy coding, and feel free to contribute to the project!
